        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>Right now I am self-studying JavaScript and Computer Science fundamentals 
          using online platforms like Udacity, Khan Academy and FreeCodeCamp. 
          I plan to enroll in a coding boot camp in the next couple of months 
          and then apply to Software Engineering jobs.

      <h2>The Past</h2>
      <p>My most recent job before I 
        decided to switch careers was teaching kids at an alternative school
         that focuses on social and emotional learning. I worked with a team 
         of social workers, administrators, behavior specialists and special 
         education teachers. Before this, I worked as an ABA therapist and a 
         job coach/provider for kids with autism and adults with developmental disabilities. 
         Iâ€™ve worked totally in special education for 10 years.</p>

        <h2>A Little More About Me</h2>
        <p> I love working with and helping people. 
          I decided to make a career change because I was feeling burnt out, but I have learned
           an incredible amount from my time in education which I am grateful for. I have gained many 
           valuable skills that will stay with me on my next career journey.
          In my free time I like to work on creative projects like painting, jewelry making and dance.
